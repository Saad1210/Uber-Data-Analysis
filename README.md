# Uber-Data-Analysis

**Project Overview**

The project involves an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset comprising 31 million rows of Uber ride data over one year. The analysis aims to uncover insights into Uber's revenue trends, peak times, and other operational metrics by examining trip origins, destinations, pickup/drop-off times, trip distances, and durations. Despite challenges posed by missing data, the project successfully computes Uber's total income and revenue trends during the year.

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning:
    - Checked for missing values in the dataset using Pandas.
    - Destination Column: Discovered 1.3 million missing entries. Used mode imputation to fill missing values since they had corresponding data in other columns (origin, trip duration, etc.).
    - Trip Distance and Duration Columns: Addressed missing values using mean imputation to ensure data integrity.

2. Feature Engineering:
    - Created new columns to enhance the analysis:
          - Year, Month, and Day: Extracted from the pickup date to analyze temporal trends.
          - Trip Revenue: Calculated using the following fare structure:
                    - Base fare: $2.55
                    - Per minute: $0.35
                    - Per mile: $1.75
                    - Minimum fare: $8.00

3. Revenue Analysis:
    - Computed the total revenue generated by Uber over the year.
    - Analyzed monthly revenue trends to identify peak periods and seasonal effects.
